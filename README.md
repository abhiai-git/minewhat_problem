# MineWhat Problem - Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a project focused on solving a data analysis problem, likely related to customer behavior or market insights, for "MineWhat".

## Overview

This project involves analyzing data to derive actionable insights, potentially for a business intelligence or marketing context. The structure suggests a complete data science workflow, from data acquisition and processing to analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Project Structure

- `Code/`: Contains all scripts and notebooks used for data processing, analysis, and model development. This could include Python scripts, R scripts, or Jupyter notebooks.
- `Dashboard/`: Likely holds files related to data visualization and interactive dashboards, possibly using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or web-based frameworks (e.g., Flask/Dash).
- `Data/`: Stores the raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
- `Result/`: Contains the outcomes of the analysis, such as reports, key findings, statistical summaries, and final visualizations.

## Inferred Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition & Preparation**: Data is stored in the `Data/` directory, suggesting a process of collecting and cleaning raw information.
2. **Code & Analysis**: The `Code/` directory indicates the use of programming for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and potentially machine learning.
3. **Visualization & Reporting**: The `Dashboard/` and `Result/` directories point to the creation of visual summaries and comprehensive reports to present findings.

## Technologies (Inferred)

- **Python / R**: Common languages for data analysis.
- **Pandas / NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (if applicable).
- **SQL / NoSQL Databases**: For data storage and retrieval (if external databases were used).
- **Dashboarding Tools**: Tableau, Power BI, or custom web dashboards.

## How to Explore

- To understand the analytical methods, explore the `Code/` directory.
- For raw and processed data, refer to the `Data/` directory.
- To view the final insights and visualizations, check the `Result/` and `Dashboard/` directories.
